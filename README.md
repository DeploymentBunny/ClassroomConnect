# Classroom Connect
Johan Arwidmark and I, needed a solution to connect in various ways to our student's training machines.
These are:
- Remote Desktop
- Remote Desktop using a Shadow session
- Remote Assistance

This script will get all computers from a predefined OU, feed them into a listbox and then present 3 ways to connect
